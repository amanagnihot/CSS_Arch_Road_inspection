3-02-26- Road Defect Segmentation: U-Net+ResNet18 vs Depthwise-Separable Custom Architecture | PyTorch, Albumentations, COCO Format | Baseline Comparison (14M→1M params, 90%+ accuracy retention) for Edge Deployment

04-02-2026	Modelling	Aman	Road Defect Detection: RT-DETR-R18 vs RoadDefectNet-Lite | PyTorch, YOLOv11 Format, MobileNetV3-Small Backbone	Baseline Comparison (28M→2.3M params, 12x lighter, 3x faster) for Jetson Nano/Drone Edge Deployment

05-02-2026 Modelling Aman Distilation of RTDETR-R18 and improvement of Custom mdoel architecture , paper review Loss function was just learning to detect no object so it is performing better in map but when testing on real world it is failing

06-02-2026  Modelling Aman Updated the custom architecture and improved the threshold for testing detection and updated the data set by removing unbalanced class improved data balancing improves training threshold value is reduced to remove zero precision
